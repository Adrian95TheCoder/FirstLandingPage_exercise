# FirstLandingPage_exercise
My first public project of my own landing page.
Here i want to describe what i learned during this project (problems and ways to solve them). 
At first of all i have started from created repository on github then clone them into my device.
I made a small project of website on paper (necessary: need to find app).
Then i wrote navigation-my idea was created conatiner for navigation items.
I used flexbox to position nav items.
Here i found something like wrapper- this settings helps to keeps section in center on biggests devices.
In second step was made hero section with light blue filter on it -it makes letter more presentable. 
Is transform a god way to position hero text? How to made it with flexbox?
